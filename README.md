# GithubDemo

This sample code that implement MVVM architecture using Android architecture component intensively and coroutines

I create this repo for a few reasons:

  1.Get feedback from other developers to improve my code
  2.To understand architecture component in sample way 
  3.To apply what I have learned
  4.To use as starting point for future projects
