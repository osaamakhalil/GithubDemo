# GithubDemo

This sample code that implement MVVM architecture using Android architecture component intensively and coroutines

I create this repo for a few reasons:

  1. Get feedback from other developers to improve my code
  2. To understand architecture component in sample way 
  3. To apply what I have learned
  4. To use as starting point for future projects
